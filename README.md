Rakta Sansaar is a geolocation-based Blood Donation Management System developed as a college project. The system aims to efficiently connect blood donors and recipients by leveraging location data and blood type compatibility.

Features
Geolocation Matching: Uses the Haversine formula and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find and match donors with recipients based on proximity and blood type.

User Authentication: Secure signup and login system for donors and recipients.

Responsive Frontend: Built with React and Tailwind CSS, providing an intuitive and mobile-friendly user interface.

RESTful APIs: Backend services developed with Node.js and MongoDB to handle user data, blood group management, and matching logic.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for clean, modern, and responsive UI design.

Backend: Node.js and Express.js for API development and server-side logic.

Database: MongoDB for flexible, scalable data management.

Algorithms: Haversine formula for distance calculation and KNN for proximity-based matching.

My Role
Developed responsive frontend components using React and Tailwind CSS.

Designed and implemented backend RESTful APIs with Node.js and MongoDB.

Integrated geolocation-based matching using the Haversine formula combined with the KNN algorithm.

Ensured smooth coordination between frontend and backend to deliver real-time donor-recipient matching.
