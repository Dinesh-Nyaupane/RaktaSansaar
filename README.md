A geolocation-based Blood Donation Management System developed as a college project. Worked on both frontend and backend â€” built responsive user interfaces using React and Tailwind CSS, and developed RESTful APIs with Node.js and MongoDB. Integrated Haversine formula and KNN algorithm to match donors and recipients by location and blood type.
